**Tuesday, July 30: 1:00-4:00pm** 

* 1:00-1:15pm: Brief Introductions of everyone in the workshop
  * Share your name, institution, and animagus. 
* 1:15-1:40pm: What is Science? Brainstorm of the scientific method ([White Board Exercise](E2M3-ATBC-2019/1_What_is_Science.pdf): **Need one facilitator and one scribe!**)
* 1:40-2:00pm: What are We Doing Here? Data and Models (Lecture: **Tanjona**)
    * Can be structured however you like but needs to categorize and distinguish statistical and mechanistic models.
    * While Tanjona is lecturing, I'm going to try to generate some fake data that addresses whatever question they come up with and can be modeled both statistically and mechanistically.
* 2:00-2:05pm: Stretch Break
* 2:05-2:30pm: Intro to Statistical Modeling ([White Board Exercise](E2M3-ATBC-2019/2_Intro_To_Statistical_Models.pdf): **Need one facilitator and one scribe!**)
    * Goal of this session will be to give a brief intro as to what statistical modeling is, then have the students develop a conceptual framework for what their actual statistical model would look like (i.e. Identify the response variable, predictor variable(s), any random effects, the distribution, and the link function).
    * Can be entirely a white-board based exercise if you prefer or can use some powerpoint material
* 2:30-2:45pm: Constructing a Statistical Model (Guided Computer Tutorial: **Cara, or anyone else who wants to try!**) 
    * Using fake data generated during Tanjona's lecture (above), I'm going to walk through how to build and fit a statistical model in R and try to parallel the takeaway points from Tanjona's lecture and the white board walk-through above 
* 2:45-2:50pm: Stretch Break  
* 2:50-3:15pm: Intro to Mechanistic Modeling ([White Board Exercise](E2M3-ATBC-2019/3_Intro_To_Compartmental_Models.pdf): **Need one facilitator and one scribe!**)
    * Goal of this session will be to give a brief intro as to what mechanistic modeling is, then have the students           develop a conceptual framework for what their actual statistical model would look like
    * Can be entirely a white-board based exercise if you prefer or can use some powerpoint material
* 3:15-3:35pm: Constructing a Mechanistic Model (Guided Computer Tutorial:  **Cara, or anyone else who wants to try!**) 
    * During this module, I'll use the same topic and fake data highlighted above but build a mechanistic model instead.
    * I'll use a least squares function (maybe pre-prep it) to fit the model to the data
* 3:35-4:00pm: Putting it all in Perspective (Lecture: **Tanjona**)
    * Review the major concepts and advertise for E^2^M^2^ 2020!
