We are pleased to announce the sixth annual E<sup>2</sup>M<sup>2</sup>:  Ecological and Epidemiological Modeling in Madagascar. The course will consist of a week-long intensive workshop aimed to provide an introduction to the use of dynamical models in understanding ecological and epidemiological data, followed by a final symposium where students will have a chance to present original research.
-->


Throughout E<sup>2</sup>M<sup>2</sup>, students will participate in a series of interactive lectures and computer-based tutorials and learn to fine-tune model-based research questions, develop clear model frameworks and corresponding equations, and fit models to real-world data. All students will work closely with peers and faculty to develop a research plan for an ongoing or existing project integrating dynamical modeling with data collection and/or analysis in a biological system of their choosing. These research plans can then be used as a foundation for future dissertation or grant proposals. 

The course will be targeted towards students in their third cycle or higher in biology, mathematics, medicine, public health, or related fields, though all are welcome to apply. The course will be taught primarily in English, though a subset of the faculty will be available to offer some translation into French and/or Malagasy. A working knowledge of the English language is required for admission; however, we will do our best to make the material accessible to students who find English challenging.
