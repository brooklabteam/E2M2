If you will be bringing a personal laptop to the workshop, please be sure that the following programs are installed and working:

* Excel, or a compatible spreadsheet software such as [Google Spreadsheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/)
* R – a statistical programming language ([Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/), [Linux](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/), and [MacOS](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/))
* [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) – a user interface for R that will be needed for computer exercises
* [MEGA: Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis](https://www.megasoftware.net/) - a tool for aligning sequences and building phylogenies.

If you will not be bringing your own computer to the workshop, we will still expect you to complete the preparatory tutorials in R, so please locate a computer in your area on which you can install and begin these tutorials.
