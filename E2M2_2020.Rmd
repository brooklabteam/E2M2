Please follow instructions for installing packages in R [here](E2M2-2018/E2M2_InstallPackages.html).


**Saturday, Jan 11: ‘R Bootcamp’ (attendance optional)** *(at [Institut Pasteur de Madagascar](http://www.pasteur.mg/) in Antananarivo)*

* 8:30-9:00am: Brief Introductions 
* 9:00-9:45am: Lecture: Intro to R Studio 
  * Slides Only Here. Students should not follow along with their own computers yet.

* 10:15-11:15am: Small Groups: Software installation and catch-up. Mentors + instructors make sure all students have the proper materials installed and work through Intro Tutorial 
  * Let's make only **1 Intro R Tutorial** for Workshop preparation and streamline topics across the 4 tutorials     taught in previous years.
* 11:15am-12:00pm: Tutorial: Intro to R Studio 
  * Here students actually start coding, but let's design the script such that they have a blank script that        challenges them to write their own code, then furnish a supplementary script with the answers to follow.
  * Include topics such as:
      * Knowing your working environment
      * Assigning variables
      * Basic arithmetic
      * Running a script
* 12:00-1:00pm: Lunch
* 1:00-3:00pm: Lecture/Tutorial: Exploring & visualizing data in R
  * Let's redesign script as above. Provide one script with blanks for the students to work through and a second   with the answers in case they get stuck.
* 3:00-3:30pm: Coffee Break
* 3:30-4:30pm: Lecture/Tutorial: Writing For-loops, If-Else Statements, and Functions in R 
  * Let's redesign script as above. Provide one script with blanks for the students to work through and a second   with the answers in case they get stuck.
* 4:30-5:30pm: Open mentoring session for outstanding questions

* 8:30-9:00pm: Ice Breakers 
  * Ice Breaker teams like those from last year are good, but let's keep things simple. Teams should do the         following:
    * Make a team name and logo.
    * Address one course-related challenge per day (presented with each day - see below)
    * Address the following "bonus" challenges if desired: Fun-Translate function, Speaking French to Amy, ...?


**Monday, Jan 13 “Dealing with Data”**

* 6:30-8:00am: Breakfast

* 2:30-3:30pm: Formulating research questions - let's walk through a stat Q and a mech Q entirely all the way           from question to compartmentments (no R code or equations needed yet) so that students know where they          are headed
        * Will take a while. Move through stat model quickly, then, for mechanistic, brainstorm states and                processes, then cull them to the essential, then build boxes together
        * Break up with coffee break in the middle.
        * Try to get one question ecology-related and one disease related
* 3:00-3:30pm: Coffee Break
* 3:30-4:00pm: Formulating research questions (continued - finish here)
* 4:30-5:30pm: Study Design and Data Collection 
  * Ideally, let's have examples from both ecology and epidemiology. (Could combine with timeslot before into       one lecture).
  * Would be best to have a tutorial that shows how we do this. Power analysis, etc. Could we generate some data     to clean/analyze later? 
* 5:30-6:30pm: Data cleaning tutorial?
* 6:30-7:30pm: Dinner
